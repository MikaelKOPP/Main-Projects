** 🎮 Terminal-based Adventure Game **
This game was created as a project to learn Python and have fun with the language. The code is currently unoptimized and a work in progress.

** 🕹️ How to Play **
Runs in the terminal
Choose a direction: North, West, South, East (input should be n,s,w,e)
When met with an event where you type in text, or use items, buy items etc... it is determined by entydighet -> eg. 'to' for 'torso', or 'hea' for 'healing potion'.
⚠️ IMPORTANT: Whenever prompted by the "Choose a direction (N, S, W, E):", you may type 'p' (prints current path), 'h' (show healthbar), 'u' (use/display items)
⚠️ You cannot go back (e.g., choosing North after South is invalid)
